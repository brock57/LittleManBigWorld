I am working with my 12-year-old son on a vibe coding project. We want to create a PWA that allows us to simulate the user experience for mobile installs. We want to treat this as a proof of concept where we can explore options for rapidly building an application and iterating in a manner similar to software engineering best practices.

As follows will be his explanation of the application and characteristics around it

I want an app where people go to find cool places for vacation spots. I want it to be just like a TikTok where people can go see a short video of the place, and if they really like it, they can swipe right, they can heart, comment, learn more, and share with other people. And I want you to be able to book your flight right on it. And I want a small portion from what they order.

And I also want for when you go onto the page and click for more information gives you food maker recommendations, best time of the year to go, average temperatures and more essentials that you need to know in order for you to go. I also want a page where it has most liked, and I also want a search bar so people can search up the place they are interested in and learn more about it. And you can buy Bitcoin for countries that use a lot of Bitcoin.

Also have a place where people can share their trips so we can recommend more spots that people like.

Please use this as an opportunity to do a deep investigation into this application design. Offer suggestions and, in keeping within the spirit of a proof of concept, let's identify perhaps some features which we can stub out and push away to later. Also, give us some ideas on how we can stub out videos or maybe even just have them be images for an initial carousel of destinations.

Icon guidance: I want the icon to be where there is a plane flying over the world map, and at every part of the world where it's known for, like a tropical tree or a city or cool sunsets, etc. And I want that to be my icon. Please ask clarifying questions before attempting to create this. We essentially want to create an icon that follows UX best practices and conveys common travel iconography.
